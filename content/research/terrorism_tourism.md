This paper will look at the effect the terrorist attacks in France in 2015 and 2016 had on the number of British tourists to France. The paper will use quarterly tourism outflow data for a carefully chosen sample of countries, before and after terrorism has occurred. Employing a synthetic control method it will look at the short- and long-run effects of these attacks.
