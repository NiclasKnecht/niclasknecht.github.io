This paper examines the impact of the 2015 and 2016 terrorist attacks in France on the number of British tourists visiting the country. Using quarterly tourism outflow data from a select group of countries, both before and after the attacks, the study employs a synthetic control method to analyze the short- and long-term effects of these incidents.
