## Content

The goal is to teach the functioning and the welfare properties of competitive markets. The emphasis is on the interdependence of different markets (general equilibrium) and the resulting insights into welfare economics. Towards these goals the topics of preference relations, consumer theory, decisions under uncertainty, intertemporal decisions, producer theory and taxation of goods are introduced. Partial equilibrium is developed as a special case of general equilibrium.
