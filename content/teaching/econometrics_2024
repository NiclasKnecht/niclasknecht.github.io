## Content

The course provided students with a more advanced look into the methods of Econometrics. Here, we looked at regular OLS, its problems, and potential remedies. In particular, the Gauss-Markov Theorem, the omitted variable bias (OVB), misspecified models, the issue of heteroskedasticity, and the linear probability model (LPM) will be discussed. In these tutorials, students worked on both theoretical problems, that are close to the course material by Valerio Sterzi, as well as practical problems, using the statistical software for data 'Stata'.

## Tutorial 1 (due 15.02.2024, 11h30)

OLS. Expected Value. Heteroskedasticity. 

[Here](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fewster/325/notes/ch3.pdf) you can find information on expected values and the rules governing them.


##### Problem set

- [Problem Set 1](/teaching/econometrics_2024_ps1.pdf)

I have been made aware of a small error in question 3, where the denominator is missing a square. I have uploaded a corrected version. I apologise for the inconvenience caused.
